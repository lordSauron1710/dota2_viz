# Roadmap

## Ideas

- Hero view: add Shift + scroll to pan (scroll stays zoom).
- After lighting + animation: add speed control and dynamic backdrops/environments.
- Theme color: analyze the selected hero assets and pick a dominant color to drive UI accents (e.g., Kez -> blue instead of the current orange).
- Auto-populate hero assets from the user's dropdown selection using the workshop requirements data.
- After auto-population, verify all existing features still work.
